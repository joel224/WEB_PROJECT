# **App Name**: Animated Portfolio Intro

## Core Features:

- Text Display: Display the name 'joel joshy' prominently.
- GSAP Animation: Animate the text dynamically using GSAP with ScrollTrigger for 'reveal on scroll' effects, creating a smooth and engaging appearance.
- Framer Motion Effects: Apply an additional dynamic visual effect surrounding the name using Framer Motion and React Three Fiber (R3F). These effects might be particles, a glow, or a morphing shape that interacts with the name and moves randomly without intersection.

## Style Guidelines:

- Background color: A dark, desaturated blue (#222A3F) to make the animated elements stand out. Dark color scheme.
- Primary color: Vibrant, saturated teal (#45D9C1) for the animated text to catch the user's eye and imply sophistication. A light scheme color that contrasts well with the background.
- Accent color: A cooler, desaturated light cyan (#73BFE2) to add subtle depth to the surrounding effect. Analogous hue to primary, but different brightness and saturation.
- Font: 'Space Grotesk' sans-serif font for a clean, modern, and slightly technical appearance that fits well with animation.
- Use smooth, dynamic animations for the text intro/exit using GSAP with ScrollTrigger, and complementary surrounding effects using Framer Motion and R3F to draw the eye and create visual interest.
- Center the name 'joel joshy' horizontally and vertically on the screen to focus user attention. All effects will radiate outward from this point.
